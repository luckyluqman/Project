chart 2: snapshot of energy & environment data per state,
use chart from: http://bl.ocks.org/NPashaP/a74faf20b492ad377312, add data of 1) energy consumption, 2) co2 emission

chart 3: projected of co2 emission up to 2050
use chart from: http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4060954, and data of co2 projection
